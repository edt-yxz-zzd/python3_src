Chapter 6. Server Configuration
svnserve, a Custom Server
svnserve as a Windows service
First, notice that the svnserve.exe program must always be invoked with the --service option. Any other options to svnserve must then be specified on the same line, but you cannot add conflicting options such as --daemon (-d), --tunnel, or --inetd (-i). Options such as -r or --listen-port are fine, though. Second, be careful about spaces when invoking the SC.EXE command: the key= value patterns must have no spaces between key= and must have exactly one space before the value. Lastly, be careful about spaces in your command line to be invoked. If a directory name contains spaces (or other characters that need escaping), place the entire inner value of binpath in double quotes, by escaping them:

C:\> sc create svn
        binpath= "\"C:\program files\svn\bin\svnserve.exe\" --service -r C:\repos"
        displayname= "Subversion Server"
        depend= Tcpip
        start= auto
Also note that the word binpath is misleading¡ªits value is a command line, not the path to an executable. That's why you need to surround it with quotes if it contains embedded spaces.

Once the service is defined, it can be stopped, started, or queried using standard GUI tools (the Services administrative control panel), or at the command line:

C:\> net stop svn
C:\> net start svn
The service can also be uninstalled (i.e., undefined) by deleting its definition: sc delete svn. Just be sure to stop the service first! The SC.EXE program has many other subcommands and options; run sc /? to learn more about it.
