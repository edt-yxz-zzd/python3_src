A simple graph, also called a strict graph (Tutte 1998, p. 2), is an unweighted, undirected graph containing no graph loops or multiple edges (Gibbons 1985, p. 2; West 2000, p. 2; Bronshtein and Semendyayev 2004, p. 346). A simple graph may be either connected or disconnected.
Unless stated otherwise, the unqualified term "graph" usually refers to a simple graph. A simple graph with multiple edges is sometimes called a multigraph (Skiena 1990, p. 89).
