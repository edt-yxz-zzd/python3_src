we can treat DAG as a compact forest
forest node = a path (may empty) begin at any DAG source vertex
forest edge =[logical_eq]= a nonempty path begin at any DAG source vertex
forest edge (n1->n2) =[logical_eq]= to_DAG_path(n2)
    assert to_DAG_path(n2)[:-1] == to_DAG_path(n1)

why?
    used when we try to canon unlabelled unrooted undirected forest to [labelled] rooted directed compact forest.
    the result rooted directed compact forest is represented by a DAG.
