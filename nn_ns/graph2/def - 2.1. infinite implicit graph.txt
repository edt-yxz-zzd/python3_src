explicit graph
    vertex_eq
        so we can have an inefficient Map<Vertex, color> by [(Vertex, color)]
    maybe infinite
        e.g. 0->1->2->...
implicit graph
    may no num_vertices
        # infinite or not explicit
    may no vertex_eq/aedge_eq
        # not algorithm
        # vertex = graph | knot | lambda_expr | group_repr | ...
        # vertex_eq = GI | knot iso | formal system isomorphism | ...

    when doing dfs, only below graphs supported:
        # since cannot color vertices
        * sourced finite uforest with vertex_eq
            # need vertex_eq to avoid parent since undirected
            # no get_may_parent since undirected
            #   we have to store ancestor_stack
            #
            # if is_local_outgo_hedges_circlic_ordered:
            #   has outgo_hedge2next_outgo_hedge and hedge_eq
            #   we neednot to store ancestor_children_iterator_stack

        * sourced finite DAG_as_compact_forest
            # need not vertex_eq to avoid parent since DAG
            # no get_may_parent since many parents
            #   we have to store ancestor_stack
            #
