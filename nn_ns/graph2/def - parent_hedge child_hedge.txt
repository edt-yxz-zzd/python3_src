parent_hedge is a hedge
    let vtx = hedge2vtx(hedge)
    parent_hedge is parent of vtx in a dynamic implicit tree
        e.g. in a dfs tree
child_hedge


NOTE: not to confuse with income_hedge and outgo_hedge
    income_hedge/outgo_hedge is determined by the graph
    but parent_hedge/child_hedge is determined by a dynamic implicit tree
