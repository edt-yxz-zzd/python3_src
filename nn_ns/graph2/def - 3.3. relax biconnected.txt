    see: relax planar embedding

using fvertices instead of vertices
    i.e. donot consider isolated vertices

[g is relax biconnected] =[def]=
    [g is ugraph][each connected component of g is isolated vertex or biconnected]

    ==>> [no self_loop][vertex degree >= 2][num_vertices >= 2][num_aedges >= 2]
