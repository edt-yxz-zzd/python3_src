hweighted = hedge weighted

colored:
    vertex2color
weighted:
    aedge2weight
hweighted:
    hedge2hweight

they should be a speration function
    i.e. should not be a part of graph
    like the planar embedding of planar graph

why?
    hedge2weight instead of aedge2weight
        e.g. in SPQR-tree:
                a non-rooted R have a parent-importer aedge e
                for each direction of e, we compute the weight of e
                    from color of vertices in R and R structure
                then e has two weights, one weight per direction.
