optionaledge_bgraph
    a bgraph which a qedge correspond to at most one aedge per aedge type:
        qedge
        ()
            - at most one ledge; loose_edge
        (v,bool)
            - "v->" at most one ihedge
            - "v<-" at most one ehedge
        (v,bool, bool,u)   # (v==u or v!=u)
            - v -><- u : at most one uedge
            - v ->-> u : at most one dedge from v to u
            - v <-<- u : at most one dedge from u to v
            - v <--> u : at most one oedge

    simple xgraph is optionaledge_bgraph
        and has no (), (v,b), (v,b,b',v)
        and ((all (v-><-u)) | (all (v->->u)))
