hedge relationship
    e.g. planar embedding of a graph
        the hedges of a vtx has a cyclic relationship
    since graph is use to represent relationship
    we introduce a graph to represent hedge relationship
        vertices of this new graph =
            hedges of old graph
            [+ may old graph vertices]
            [+ may other new vertices]
    we can merge old and new graph to big graph:
        vertices of this big graph =
            hedges of old graph
            + old graph vertices
            [+ may other new vertices]
        edges of this big graph =
            new graph edges
            # no old graph edges!!
            big edge from hedge to its old vtx
            big edge of 2 adj hedges

        color of big vtx =
            (VTX_tag, old color of vtx, maybe new color of vtx) if vtx is old graph vertex
            (HEdeg_tag, new color of hedge) if big vtx is hedge
            (NewVTX_tag, new color of vtx) otherwise
        weight of big edge =
            (NewEdge_tag, weight[aedge]) if aedge is new graph edge
            (HEdge2Vtx_tag,) if big edge from hedge to its old vtx
            (AdjHEdge_tag,) if big edge of 2 adj hedges
