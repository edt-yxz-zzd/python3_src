fvertex - fake vertex
    like fface

used for fake embedding
fake_embedding consider only hedges
    so we use fvertex to repr non-isolated vertex # vertex of degree >= 1

for fake_embedding
    num_fvertices
    fvertex2degree
    hedge2fvertex
    fvertex2arbitrary_hedge
for ugraph
    vertex2maybe_fvertex
    fvertex2vertex
