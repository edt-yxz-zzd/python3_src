directed graph connectivity

weakly connected
    undirected underlying graph
strongly connected




https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph
A directed graph is weakly connected (or just connected) if the undirected underlying graph obtained by replacing all directed edges of the graph with undirected edges is a connected graph. A directed graph is strongly connected or strong if it contains a directed path from x to y and a directed path from y to x for every pair of vertices {x, y}. The strong components are the maximal strongly connected subgraphs.
