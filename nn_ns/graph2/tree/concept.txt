unrooted tree
    No!!!! ??MUST be undirected??
        directed linear graph but donot know in_tree or out_tree
    may have explicit parent if directed

rooted tree
    out_rooted tree
    in_rooted tree
    have implicit parent

out_tree
    out_rooted
    vtx has outgoings
    self outgoing: self->child
in_tree
    in_rooted
    vtx has incomes
    self income: child->self

undirected tree
    no explicit parent
    may have implicit parent if rooted
directed tree
    vtx has parent
    out_tree has no child->parent
    in_tree has no parent->child

[rooted unordered tree]
    -- has a root
    -- children have no order

[rooted tree]
