big_char - split array into blocks
    may overlap each other
    may not cover some leading elements

let L = len(array)
example:
    split into triples:
        i2big_char i m = array[i:i+m]
        triples_mod k m = [i2big_char(i,m) for i in range(k, L, m)]
        array ==>> triples_mod 1 3 + triples_mod 2 3
            leave the head element

    split into pairs:
        array ==>> [i2big_char(i,2) for i in range(L) if i%3]
