like choice_concat but no "? + *"

grammar is sth like:
    # this is a comment
    xx :
    yy : xx xx
    z = x xx
    q =
    t : 
        yy
        xx : ...
        kk :
            ...
        uu = ...



grammar:
    single line comment : # ...
    allow emptylines
    indent = 4 ascii spaces
    no strings
    no line joining rules; physical line is logical line
    cannot access XX.XXX ; since '.' is part of name
    can only refer to toplevel names
    no nongreedy and no counts:
        no '? * +' ; no '?? *? +?'
    in one block, names can not duplicate


    name is '\S+'
    keyword is '[=:]'
    nonemptyline should be : <indent>* <name> (<keyword> <name>*)? <spaces-comment>? <newline>

NOTE:
    'xx =' and 'xx :' are allowed; empty concat and empty choice
    NOT 'xx=' or 'xx:'; they are names
    
    
    regex'(?<!\S)#[ #].*' is a comment
    NOT '#xxx' or 'xx# ...' or 'xxx##...'


NOTE:
    one choice is the same as 'is'
    now, there is no 'is' command, using 'xxx : xxx' instead
