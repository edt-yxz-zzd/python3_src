Attribute grammars It is doubtful, however, that they are
generative grammars, since it is next to impossible to use them as a sentenceproduc-tionmechanism; they should rather be classified as recognition systems.
Watt and Madsen [259] have extended the affix grammars with a transduction
mechanism, resulting in the EAGs. These can be viewed as attribute grammars with
generative power, or as affix grammars with semantics.
