all names should be unique, since each repr a node


# nodes progma
# indicates which name is allowed, and assign an index to it
    --nodes = name1 name2
# or
    --nodes = [x..y]

# color progma
    --colors = color1 c2 ... # all color names
    --colors = [a..b]
    --node2color = c1 cX ... # a list of length equal length of nodes list
# weight progma
    --weights = w1 w2
    --weights of int/real/complex/...
    # using:
    #   succ_node / weight : ...
    # edge index by the order it defined.
1) tree/forest
    # no duplicated names
    parent :
        child1 : ...
        leaf
        
2) digraph/graph (simple - no multiedges, no self-loops)
    # like above, but allowed duplicated names in different block/layer
    prev :
        succ1 : ...
        succ2
3) digraph/graph (multiedges, self-loops)
4) udgraph (mixed-edges: both directed and undireted)
    prev :
        succ1 : ...
        succ2
    prev <: ... # undirected
