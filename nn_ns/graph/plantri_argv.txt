plantri generates triangulation planar graph
what I want is cubic planar graph with imbedding and 2/3-connected
    // why I want them?
    // for grid drawing: 'cubic planar' is important
    // Steinitz's theorem: convex polyhedron = 3-connected planar graph
    // so, 3-connected cubic planar graph = Cubic Polyhedral Graph
    // '2-connected' for compare

the dual of triangulation planar graph is cubic planar, and vice versa
but the vertex connectivity may not hold
but for 2/3, it holds!!!


       -c3m3 (default)  3-connected planar triangulation.  
               The dual is a 3-connected planar cubic graph.
               Both primal and dual graphs are simple.

       -c2  2-connected planar triangulation with minimum degree at least 3.
            There may be parallel edges (but remember it is a triangulation
            so there must be things between each pair of them).  There are
            no loops.  The dual is a 2-connected simple planar cubic graph. .

       -c2x  Same as -c2 except that there must be at least one pair of
            parallel edges.  In the dual, at least one cutset of size 2.

        -c2 = -c3 + -c2x
parallel edges: but not edge of same face; 
    planar triangulation of connectitivity 2 must contain parallel edges



plantri -a [-u] [-V] -d -v -<c2x|c3>m3 <cubic_graph_order>d [output_file]



-a // for imbedding !!!! 
  ASCII CODE is a human-readable version of planar code.  The vertices of
     the graph are named by ASCII characters starting with 'a'.  Example:
        7 bcdefg,agfdc,abd,acbfe,adf,aedbg,afb
     This is a graph with 7 vertices a,b,c,d,e,f,g.  The neighbours of
     'a' in clockwise order are b,c,d,e,f,g; and so on.  Each graph occupies
     one line of output.  Ascii code is convenient if you just want to draw
     a few graphs by hand.
     To select ascii code use -a.

-u
  If you only want to count the graphs and not write them, use -u to 
  select no output.



  An example of a plantri run is:  
      plantri -d 16
  which makes the duals (because -d is present) of the 3-connected
  triangulations with 16 vertices.  In other words, it makes the
  3-connected cubic planar graphs with 28 vertices.

  The only compulsory parameter is the number of vertices ("16" in the
  example).  This can also be given as "28d" (the suffix 'd' means 'dual')
  in which case it is converted by adding 4 then dividing by 2:
  (28+4)/2 = 16.  In the case of triangulations, this calculation yields
  the number of faces, which is the number of vertices in the dual cubic
  graph.

  -d   causes the dual graph to be written instead of the original graph.
       Note that it is applied only at the output stage.  All other switches
       refer to the original graph before the dual is taken.  For example,
       -m4 (minimum degree at least 4) refers to the original graph and
       not to the dual. 

  -V   Only output graphs with non-trivial group.  If -o is given, the
       O-P group is used.  Otherwise, the full group.  Implies -G.

  -v   plantri will always tell you (by a message to standard error) the
       number of graphs that were produced.  If you specify -v, it might
       tell you some additional statistical information.  For example, if
       you use -o, -v will cause it to also inform you of the number of
       isomorphism classes as well as the number of isomorphism classes
       which are O-P isomorphic to their mirror images.




  The character # refers to a non-negative integer.

  We begin with a few switches available in multiple circumstances.

  -m#  Specify a lower bound on the minimum degree.  In the dual graph this
       means a lower bound on the minimum face size.  The default is -m3.

  -c#  Specify a lower bound on the connectivity.  The meaning in the dual
       graph will be explained in each case.  The default is -c3.
       (-c4 has a slightly weaker meaning with -q, see below.)

  -x   When used in combination with -c#, the connectivity must be exactly #,
       rather than at least #.  (Some exceptions are noted below.)




  If all the faces of an imbedded graph are triangles (i.e. bounded by 3
  edges) the imbedded graph is called a TRIANGULATION.  The literature
  is divided over whether the outside face must be a triangle, but we will
  take it that ALL faces are triangles.  The dual of a triangulation is an
  imbedded cubic (trivalent) graph.   A triangulation with n vertices has
  exactly 3n-6 edges and 2n-4 faces.

  A graph (imbedded or not) is k-CONNECTED if it cannot be disconnected by
  removing k or fewer vertices.  It is convenient to revise the definition
  slightly for the complete graph K4: it is 3-connected but not 4-connected.
  A standard theorem says that a triangulation is 3-connected if and only
  if it has no loops or parallel edges.  It is impossible for a planar
  graph to be k-connected for k greater than 5.

  A SIMPLE graph is one with no parallel edges or loops.

  An ISOMORPHISM from G to H is either an O-P isomorphism or an O-R isomorphism.
