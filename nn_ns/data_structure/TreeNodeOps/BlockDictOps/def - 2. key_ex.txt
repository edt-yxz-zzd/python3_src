key_ex used to repr left_bound and right_bound of range

[1/2, 4/5] == (TheKey 1/2, TheKey 4/5)
(1/2, 4/5] == (More 1/2, TheKey 4/5)
(1/2, 4/5) == (More 1/2, Less 4/5)
(-oo, 4/5) == (-inf, Less 4/5)
(-oo, +oo) == (-inf, +inf)

lkey_ex = left_bound = TheKey key | More key | -inf
rkey_ex = right_bound = TheKey key | Less key | +inf
