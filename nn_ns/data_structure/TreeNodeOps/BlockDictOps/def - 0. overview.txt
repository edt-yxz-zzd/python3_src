set of all dict_keys SHOULD BE nonemtpy
(Eq dict_value, Ord dict_key) => Map dict_key dict_value

when two dict_keys are neighbours(i.e. succ(k1) == k2), dict_values are equal, then we merge them into (block_key, dict_value)

block_key = range = (left_bound, right_bound)
    left_bound = TheKey key | More key | -inf
    right_bound = TheKey key | Less key | +inf
        # More/Less/-inf/+inf are optional
