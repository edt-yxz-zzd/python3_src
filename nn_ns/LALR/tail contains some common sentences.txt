S = A B
S = C B
B = A C


here I ask:
    1,0 . A B
    1,1 . B
    2,0 . C B
    2,1 . B
    3,0 . A C
    3,1 . C
    does above, which pair contains some common sentences?

add diff contexts:
    . A B   {0}
    . B     {1}
    . C B   {2}
    . B     {3}
    . A C   {4}
    . C     {5}
run!!
    until we meet conflict:
        * reduce/reduce conflict
            then contexts1 /-\ contexts2 tell which pairs not disjoint
        * reduce/shift conflict
            ????
            then contexts1 /-\ contexts2 tell which one is contains prefix of others
