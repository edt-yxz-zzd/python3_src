incomplete_u2vtc :: {vertex : [vertex]}
    multiedge directed graph with loops
    but its key may not include vertices without outgoing dedges
    i.e.
        [m is an incomplete_connected_u2vtc][not m[u]]
            ==>> [(Map.remove u m) is an incomplete_connected_u2vtc]
incomplete_u2vtc vs u2vtc
    len(u2vtc) == num_vertices
    len(incomplete_u2vtc) may be not num_vertices

    u2vtc.keys include all vertices without outgoing dedges
    incomplete_u2vtc.keys may not include vertices without outgoing dedges


incomplete_u2vtc_without_isolated_vertices <: incomplete_u2vtc
    multiedge directed graph with loops without isolated_vertices

    [m is an incomplete_u2vtc_without_isolated_vertices]
        # since has no isolated_vertices
        #   , any vertex must have an outgoing or incoming dedge
        ==>> [len(m.keys()\-/ \-/~ m.values()) == num_vertices]
