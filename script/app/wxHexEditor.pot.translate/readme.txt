TODO:
    Diff with Vim : zh_CN.po translated.txt
    search гнгнгнгнгн in translated.txt and then continue translation

    when completed, call replace_the_msgstr_lines.py
    use PoEdit to find out how many/which items are not translated


------------------------  files --------------------

wxHexEditor.pot
    downloaded from wxHexEditor-office-site 20170223
zh_CN.po
    zh_CN.mo -- generated by PoEdit

    with some items I translated
    but it seems needing PoEdit Pro to translate all
    so I switch to google translation page

google_output.txt
    google translated version of zh_CN.po

    since google accept no more than 5000 characters,
        I have to split zh_CN.po into ./po/[0-7]0.po,
        translate to ./po/[0-7].txt
        and merge the result into google_output.txt
    file_split.py
    ./po/
        for %f in (*.txt) do type "%f" >> ../google_output.txt

translated.txt
    fixed version of google_output.txt

    using Diff with Vim
    гг гж б░ б▒ -> # & " "
    "бг -> бг"   -- "xxxx." -> б░XXXXб▒бг
    append missing " back to msgid line

    unknown items are deleted
        e.g. XORView Thru Warning / Open RAM Device / ...
    translated until the line contain гнгнгнгнгнгнгнгнгнгн


replace_the_msgstr_lines.py
    merge translated.txt into zh_CN.po

    follows are generated by different version replace_the_msgstr_lines.py and different verion translated.txt
        zh_CN-new1.po
        zh_CN-new2.po
        zh_CN-new3.po
        zh_CN-new4.po
        zh_CN-new5.po
